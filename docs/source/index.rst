   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pylibrary's documentation!
=====================================
pylibrary is just a collection of modules, functions, and classes that 
are generally useful. 

Particularly important modules are:

PlotHelpers : A set of routines and classes to help make nice organized
plots with matplotlib.

pyqtgraphHelpers : a set of similar routines for pyqtgraph; not as well developed
and missing some important components.

Utility : General utilities including simple digital filter setups, spike-detection,
and a datac-like sequence parser.

Routines for stats (old, may not work with current versions of libraries)

Several sets of routines for python 2.7 that need to be updated.
